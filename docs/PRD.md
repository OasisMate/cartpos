# 📄 CartPOS – v1 Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

**Working name:** CartPOS

**Target users (v1):**
- Small, single-outlet kiryana and retail shops in Pakistan are using a Windows PC + browser. Many will have a thermal printer and barcode scanner, but the system must remain fully usable without them.

**Core problem:**
- These shops rely on notebooks and calculators. They struggle to:
  - See daily sales and basic profit.
  - Track udhaar (credit) properly.
  - Control stock (which items are available/low / out).
- The Internet and power can go out for short periods, so purely online tools are unreliable at the counter.

**Core solution (v1):**
- A browser-based POS (PWA) optimized for low-end PCs that:
  - Keeps billing usable for a few hours without internet by storing data locally and syncing later.
  - Allows fast item entry via barcode scanner or manual search.
  - It is simple enough that a basic-education cashier can learn the main billing flow in under an hour.

**Hardware assumptions (v1):**
- ✅ Fully functional with: PC + browser only (no printer, no scanner).
- ✅ Optimized for: PC + browser + USB thermal printer + USB barcode scanner.
- Scanner behaves as a keyboard input; no special drivers required.

**Barcodes (v1):**
- Each product may have a barcode (optional).
- Barcode can be:
  - Manufacturer barcode, or
  - Auto-generated internal code, unique per shop.
- No label/sticker printing in v1; planned for v2+.

**Deployment & hosting (v1):**
- Application: Next.js full-stack app (App Router + Route Handlers).
- Hosting: Vercel (or similar).
- Database: Postgres (e.g., Supabase).
- Authentication: email + password + session (exact mechanism is an implementation detail).

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals (v1)

### 2.1 Primary goals

**Fast billing**
- A typical small cash sale (3–5 items) can be completed in under 15 seconds using keyboard + scanner or keyboard only.

**Offline-safe billing (a few hours)**
- If the internet goes down, the cashier can continue creating sales for at least a few hours.
- All offline sales are stored locally and automatically synced when the connection returns.

**Basic stock & udhaar control**
- The owner can see current stock levels and simple low-stock alerts.
- The owner can record udhaar and payments and see who owes how much.

**Daily summary for the owner**
- End-of-day view with:
  - Total sales.
  - Basic profit estimate (where cost data exists).
  - Breakdown by payment method (cash/card/other).
  - Total udhaar created.

### 2.2 Explicit non-goals (v1)

- No FBR integration.
- No multi-branch / multi-outlet management (one shop per account).
- No Android / mobile app (PC browser only).
- No advanced analytics or custom reporting (only simple summaries and lists).
- No split payments (only one payment method per sale).
- No item-level discounts (only bill-level discount).
- No manual invoice-level allocation UI for Udhaar payments (system auto-allocates).
- No label/sticker design and printing.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 POS Sale – Cash (v1)

**Actors:** Cashier (Bilal)

**Preconditions:**
- Cashier is logged in and a shop is selected.
- POS screen is loaded.
- Product list is available locally (synced previously).
- App may be online or offline.

**Happy path:**
1. Cashier opens POS screen.
2. Focus is on the "Scan or Search Item" input.
3. Cashier adds items:
   - **With scanner:**
     - Scans barcode → matching product auto-added to bill with quantity = 1.
   - **Without scanner:**
     - Types part of name/code → dropdown shows matches → selects to add item.
4. Cashier adjusts quantities as needed (via +/− buttons or direct entry).
5. System shows:
   - Line items (name, qty, unit price, line total).
   - Subtotal.
   - Bill Discount (amount or percentage).
   - Grand Total.
6. Cashier optionally enters a bill-level discount:
   - Either a fixed amount or percentage.
7. Cashier selects Payment Method:
   - Cash, Card, or Other.
   - Default is Cash.
8. Cashier enters Amount Received:
   - Can auto-fill with Grand Total.
   - System computes Change.
9. Cashier clicks Complete Sale.

**Data handling:**
- POS always writes the sale to local IndexedDB sales store:
  - With a client-generated id.
  - With syncStatus = "PENDING".
- If online:
  - POS also calls `/api/sales` or `/api/sales/sync-batch`.
  - On success, local record marked SYNCED.

**Server behaviour:**
- Creates Invoice and InvoiceLine entries.
- Inserts StockLedger entries for each line:
  - type = SALE
  - changeQty = −quantity.
- Creates Payment row:
  - amount = total,
  - method = chosen payment method.
- Sets paymentStatus = PAID.

**Receipts:**
- If printer is configured:
  - System prints a small receipt (58/80mm).
- If no printer:
  - Sale is still completed; no print.

**Postconditions:**
- Sale is stored locally and on server (when online or after sync).
- Stock is reduced according to sold quantities.
- Sale is included in daily summary (excluding any later VOID status).

**Constraints:**
- v1: One payment method per sale (no split).
- v1: Only bill-level discount; no item-level discount.

### 5.2 Hold / Park Sale (v1)

**Goal:** Allow cashier to temporarily park an in-progress bill and start a new one.

**Behaviour:**
- **Hold current sale:**
  - Cashier clicks Hold on POS.
  - System saves current bill as a "held sale" in local IndexedDB (e.g. heldSales store).
  - No invoice is created on the server.
  - No stock changes occur.
  - POS screen resets to a fresh empty sale.
- **View and resume held sales:**
  - Cashier opens Held Sales view.
  - List shows:
    - Short ID / label.
    - Time held.
    - Approximate total.
  - Selecting a held sale loads it back into the POS screen.
- **Complete a held sale:**
  - Once resumed, cashier processes payment as a normal sale.
  - At completion:
    - It is treated identically to a POS sale (cash/udhaar).
    - An invoice is created, stock updated, etc.

**v1 limits:**
- Entire bill is held; no partial-line hold.
- No merging or batch editing of multiple held bills.

### 5.9 Sales – Void & Edit (v1)

**Goal:** Provide "CRUD" behaviour on sales without breaking stock/accounting or offline sync.

#### 5.9.1 Void Sale

**Actors:** Shop Owner / authorized staff.

**Behaviour:**
- From sales list or invoice detail, user clicks Void Sale.

**System:**
- Sets invoice.status = VOID.
- Inserts StockLedger reversal entries:
  - For each original InvoiceLine:
    - type = ADJUSTMENT,
    - changeQty = +original quantity (restore stock).
- If sale was udhaar:
  - Inserts CustomerLedger entry:
    - type = ADJUSTMENT,
    - direction = CREDIT,
    - amount = original udhaar amount.
- If sale was fully paid (cash/card):
  - v1 does not automatically create refund; refunds (if any) handled manually / future feature.

**Voided invoices:**
- Are excluded from normal daily totals and profit calculations (or treated carefully).
- Remain visible in history, marked as VOID.

**Offline:**
- Void operations are also stored locally and synced (as updates plus ledger adjustments).

#### 5.9.2 Edit Sale

**Actors:** Shop Owner / authorized staff.

**Behaviour:**
1. User opens a completed invoice and clicks Edit.
2. System:
   - Loads original invoice data into an editable POS-like screen.
3. User modifies:
   - Items, quantities, prices (if allowed), discount, etc.
4. On saving the edited sale:

**System:**
- Performs Void Sale on the original invoice (see above).
- Creates a new invoice with the updated data:
  - New Invoice & InvoiceLines.
  - StockLedger entries for the new sale.

For a given date (default: today), show:

- Total number of completed non-VOID invoices.
- Total gross sales (sum of invoice totals).
- Total discount amount.
- Payment method breakdown:
  - Cash, Card, Other.
- Total udhaar created.
- Basic profit estimate:
  - Uses costPrice where available: sum(lineTotal − costPrice×quantity).

**UI:**
- Simple table or cards with key numbers.
- Basic filters: date selector; possibly "Today / Yesterday / Custom date".

### 5.11 Platform Admin – Hamza

**Actors:** Platform Admin.

**Capabilities:**
- **Create Shop (Tenant):**
  - Shop name.
  - City.
  - Owner name.
  - Owner email/phone.
  - Initial plan (e.g. Trial/Basic).
- **List shops:**
  - Name, city, plan, created date, last active date, status (active/inactive).
- **Change shop status:**
  - Activate / deactivate (e.g. unpaid, banned).
- **Reset owner login:**
  - Set new password or trigger password reset.
- **Impersonate shop:**
  - Log in as a shop owner for debugging/support (implementation detail; must be admin-only).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (v1)

### 6.1 Performance

- POS actions must feel instant on low-end PCs.
- A simple 3–5 item sale (with discount and cash payment) should be comfortably done within ~15 seconds by a trained cashier.

### 6.2 Offline Behaviour

**App runs as a PWA:**
- Service worker caches the app shell (JS/CSS/HTML).
- After a device has loaded the app once online, it can open the POS screen again even without internet.
- Offline mode is designed for temporary outages (hours), not for machines that have never gone online.

**Critical operations that must work offline:**
- Sales.
- Purchases.
- Basic product/customer creation.
- Udhaar payments.

**Local storage (IndexedDB) is used as the source of truth while offline.**

**Sync engine pushes local changes to the server when internet returns.**

**Sync is idempotent using client-generated IDs to avoid duplicates.**

### 6.3 Usability / Language

**v1 UI:**
- Mostly English.
- Some Roman Urdu where natural (e.g. label "Udhaar").

**v2 goal:**
- Proper bilingual Urdu + English.

**Main billing flow:**
- Should be teachable to a cashier in ~1 hour of guided training.

### 6.4 Security

**Multi-tenant isolation:**
- All server-side queries are scoped by shopId.

**Roles:**
- Platform: ADMIN, NORMAL.
- Shop: OWNER, CASHIER.

**Cashiers:**
- Limited to POS and basic screens; cannot access platform admin features.

### 6.5 Reliability

- Local data persists even if browser/tab is closed (IndexedDB, not just memory).
- Sync can recover from intermittent network failures.
- There should be no silent data loss when internet drops mid-session.

## 7. Data Model – High-Level Entities (Conceptual)

**Shop**
- id, name, city, createdAt, updatedAt.

**ShopSettings**
- shopId, requireCostPriceForStockItems (bool), requireBarcodeForProducts (bool), allowCustomUnits (bool), languageMode.

**User**
- id, name, email, hashed password, role (ADMIN/NORMAL), timestamps.

**UserShop**
- userId, shopId, shopRole (OWNER/CASHIER).

**Product**
- id, shopId, name, sku, barcode, unit, price, costPrice, category, trackStock, reorderLevel, timestamps.

**StockLedger**
- id, shopId, productId, changeQty, type (PURCHASE/SALE/ADJUSTMENT), refType, refId, createdAt.

**Supplier**
- id, shopId, name, phone, notes, createdAt.

**Purchase**
- id, shopId, supplierId?, date, reference, notes, createdByUserId, createdAt.

**PurchaseLine**
- id, purchaseId, productId, quantity, unitCost, createdAt.

**Customer**
- id, shopId, name, phone, notes, createdAt.

**CustomerLedger**
- id, shopId, customerId, type (SALE_UDHAAR, PAYMENT_RECEIVED, ADJUSTMENT), direction (DEBIT/CREDIT), amount, refType, refId, createdAt.

**Invoice**
- id, shopId, customerId?, number?, status (COMPLETED/VOID), paymentStatus (PAID/UDHAAR/PARTIAL future), paymentMethod? (CASH/CARD/OTHER or null for udhaar), subtotal, discount, total, createdByUserId, createdAt.

**InvoiceLine**
- id, invoiceId, productId, quantity, unitPrice, lineTotal, createdAt.

**Payment**
- id, shopId, invoiceId?, customerId?, amount, method (CASH/CARD/OTHER), note, createdAt.

## 8. Architecture & Deployment (v1)

### 8.1 Architecture

**Frontend + Backend:** Single Next.js app:
- App Router for UI.
- Route Handlers in `/app/api/...` for backend endpoints.

**Layers:**
- `/lib/domain/...`
  - Pure business logic (TypeScript functions).
- `/lib/db/...`
  - Prisma client and repository functions.
- `/lib/offline/...`
  - IndexedDB access + sync logic.
- `/app/(pos)`
  - POS UI.
- `/app/(backoffice)`
  - Owner views (products, purchases, customers, udhaar, summary).
- `/app/(admin)`
  - Platform admin (shops, users).

**Database:** Postgres (Supabase) accessed via Prisma.

**Hosting:** Vercel for Next.js app.

**Assumption:** v1 primarily supports one main POS device per shop; multi-device conflict handling is minimal (last write wins), improved in later versions.

### 8.2 Deployment & Offline Assumptions

- Each client device must load the app at least once online to cache PWA assets.
- After that:
  - POS can load without internet from cache.
  - Business operations use local DB when offline.
- Offline is targeted at hours, not multi-day total isolation on never-online machines.

## 9. Offline & Sync Design (v1)

**Goal:** Keep POS functional when internet is out, and reliably sync to server later.

### 9.1 Local storage (IndexedDB)

Single IndexedDB per browser origin, e.g. `kiryana_pos_db`.

**Local stores (object stores):**
- **meta** – key-value pairs:
  - e.g. currentShopId, lastSyncTime.
- **products** – cached products for POS.
- **customers** – cached customers.
- **suppliers** – cached suppliers.
- **sales** – completed sales (cash or udhaar).
- **heldSales** – in-progress but parked bills.
- **purchases** – recorded purchases waiting for sync.
- **udhaarPayments** – recorded udhaar payments waiting for sync.

**Each record includes:**
- id – client-generated ID (UUID/ULID).
- shopId.
- syncStatus: PENDING, SYNCED, FAILED (for records that must sync).
- Optional lastSyncError for debugging.

### 9.2 Online vs offline behaviour

**Online:**
- All writes go to local DB first.
- Sync worker sends them to server immediately or shortly after.
- On success, mark as SYNCED.

**Offline:**
- No API calls (or calls fail fast and are ignored).
- Writes only hit local DB with syncStatus = PENDING.
- POS shows an "Offline mode – will sync later" banner.

### 9.3 Sync process

**Triggered:**
- On app load.
- On network change (offline → online).
- On timer while online (e.g. every 30–60 seconds).

**For each store with PENDING records (sales, purchases, customers, udhaarPayments):**
1. Fetch a batch of syncStatus = PENDING entries.
2. Call the corresponding sync API:
   - `POST /api/sales/sync-batch`
   - `POST /api/purchases/sync-batch`
   - `POST /api/customers/sync-batch`
   - `POST /api/udhaar-payments/sync-batch`

**Server:**
- Uses id as the invoice/purchase/payment/customer ID.
- If a record with that id already exists → skip (idempotent).
- Else → create and return success.

**Client:**
- Mark items as SYNCED on success.
- Mark as FAILED with error info on error.

### 9.4 Conflicts & limitations (v1)

- **Sales and purchases:**
  - Treat as append-only; corrections are done via VOID + new sale/purchase.
- **Products/customers:**
  - Simple last-write-wins conflict resolution.
- **Multi-device per shop:**
  - Basic support only; heavy concurrency scenarios are not optimized in v1.
- **Offline window:**
  - Designed for hours, not indefinite offline usage on fresh uninitialized machines.

## 10. Local DB Schema – Stores Summary

**meta**
- { key: string; value: any; }
- Example keys: currentShopId, lastSyncAt.

**products**
- { id, shopId, name, unit, price, costPrice?, barcode?, trackStock, category?, reorderLevel?, stockEstimate?, updatedAt, deleted? }

**customers**
- { id, shopId, name, phone, notes?, isLocalOnly, syncStatus, lastSyncError? }

**suppliers**
- { id, shopId, name, phone?, notes?, isLocalOnly, syncStatus, lastSyncError? }

**sales**
- Completed sales (cash/udhaar):
- { id, shopId, items[], subtotal, discount, total, paymentStatus, paymentMethod?, customerId?, createdAt, syncStatus, lastSyncError? }

**heldSales**
- Parked bills, local-only:
- Similar shape to sales, but never synced until completed.

**purchases**
- { id, shopId, supplierId?, date, reference?, notes?, lines[], syncStatus, lastSyncError? }

**udhaarPayments**
- { id, shopId, customerId, amount, method, note?, createdAt, syncStatus, lastSyncError? }

## 11. API Design – High Level

### 🔹 M1 – Base Project Structure & Layout

**Goal:** Set up the skeleton folders + a basic layout UI with placeholder pages.

**Tasks:**
- **Structure:**
  - Create:
    - `lib/domain/` (empty index files for auth, shops, products, sales, etc.).
    - `lib/offline/` (empty for now).
  - Under `app/`:
    - `(pos)/` – POS UI shell.
    - `(backoffice)/` – owner back-office shell.
    - `(admin)/` – platform admin shell.
- **Layout:**
  - Implement a simple layout:
    - Top bar (app name, user avatar placeholder).
    - Sidebar or top navigation with:
      - POS
      - Products
      - Purchases
      - Customers
      - Udhaar
      - Reports
      - Admin (if admin role).
- **Routing:**
  - `/pos` → "POS coming soon" screen.
  - `/backoffice` → "Backoffice coming soon".
  - `/admin` → "Admin coming soon".

**Done when:**
- You can navigate between POS / Backoffice / Admin placeholder pages.
- Layout is consistent and not ugly enough to distract you.

### 🔹 M2 – Auth & User Sessions (Basic)

**Goal:** Log in with email/password and set up basic session handling.

(You can use NextAuth or custom JWT; plan assumes simple custom auth.)

**Tasks:**
- **Backend:**
  - Add User seed manually (admin) via Prisma Studio: email + hashed password.
  - Implement `/app/api/auth/login`:
    - Validate email/password.

    - Email + password form.
    - Call `/api/auth/login`.
  - Add simple auth hook / context:
    - Fetch `/api/me` to know who is logged in.
  - Protect routes:
    - If not logged in → redirect to `/login`.

**Done when:**
- You can:
  - Create a user in Prisma Studio.
  - Log in via `/login`.
  - See basic dashboard instead of login once authenticated.
  - Unauthenticated access to `/pos`, `/backoffice`, `/admin` redirects to `/login`.

### 🔹 M3 – Shops & User–Shop Roles

**Goal:** Multi-tenant structure ready: shops, user-to-shop link, shop-level role.

**Tasks:**
- **Backend:**
  - Implement `/app/api/admin/shops`:
    - POST: create new shop + owner user.
    - GET: list shops (admin only).
  - Implement UserShop logic:
    - A user can belong to one or more shops with shopRole (OWNER/CASHIER).
  - Update `/api/me` to return:
    - user
    - list of shops
    - current selected shop.
- **Frontend:**
  - `/admin/shops`:
    - List all shops (name, city, createdAt, status).
    - Form to create shop + owner user.
  - Shop selector:
    - If user has multiple shops, show selector in header.

      - Validate each line (product exists, quantity > 0).
      - Create Purchase + PurchaseLines.
      - For each line, create StockLedger with type PURCHASE, changeQty = +quantity.
      - If unitCost provided, update Product.costPrice.
    - Utility: `getProductStock(shopId, productId)` by summing StockLedger.changeQty.
- **API:**
  - `POST /api/purchases` → uses createPurchase.
  - `GET /api/purchases` → list purchases.
  - `GET /api/stock` (optional) → naive stock per product.

### 🔹 M8 – PWA Shell (Offline Page Load)

**Goal:** App shell can load when offline (after first online visit).

**Tasks:**
- Add `manifest.json`:
  - Name: CartPOS.
  - Icons (simple placeholder).
  - Start URL `/pos`.
- Add basic service worker:
  - Can use Next PWA plugin or manual next-pwa setup.

  - Turn off network in devtools.
  - Refresh:
    - POS shell should still load (even if API calls fail).

**Done when:**
- After one online visit, `/pos` opens offline with UI visible.

### 🔹 M9 – Local DB (IndexedDB) & Product Cache

**Goal:** Introduce IndexedDB and start caching master data locally.

  - Implement IndexedDB wrapper (Dexie or plain).
  - Create stores:
    - `meta`
    - `products`
    - `customers`
    - `suppliers`
- **Product caching:**
  - On app load (POS and backoffice):
    - Fetch `/api/products/pos`.
    - Save products to products store.
  - POS should:
    - Read products from local DB first.
    - Only call API to refresh when online, not for every search.
  - Basic sync flags (for master data):
    - `updatedAt` field stored to avoid unnecessary reloads (optional v1).
- **Testing:**
  - Load POS online.
  - Close tab, go offline, reopen:
    - Product list should still be available from IndexedDB.

**Done when:**
- POS product search works even with network off (after initial sync).

### 🔹 M10 – Local Sales Store & Sales Sync (Core Offline)

**Goal:** Sales work fully offline; syncing to backend later.

**Tasks:**
- **Local sales store:**
  - Add `sales` store in IndexedDB:
    - `{ id, shopId, items[], subtotal, discount, total, paymentStatus, paymentMethod?, customerId?, createdAt, syncStatus }`.
- **POS changes:**
  - On sale completion:
    - Always write to sales store with syncStatus = "PENDING".
    - If online:
      - Call `/api/sales`.
      - On success, set syncStatus = "SYNCED".
- **Sync worker** (`lib/offline/sync.ts`):
  - Listen to online event and/or timer.
  - When online:
    - Read all sales with syncStatus = "PENDING".
    - Batch POST to `/api/sales/sync-batch`:
      - Include id (client invoice id).
    - On success, mark each as SYNCED.
- **Backend:**
  - Implement `POST /api/sales/sync-batch`:
    - For each sale:
      - If Invoice with this id exists → skip.
      - Else → call createSale with id overridden.
- **Testing:**
  - Scenario:
    - Go online → open POS → products sync.
    - Turn off internet.
    - Create 3 sales.
    - Confirm they exist only in IndexedDB.
    - Turn internet back on.
    - Sync runs → check DB: 3 invoices created, no duplicates.
    - Reload POS → nothing pending.

**Done when:**
- You can run the POS offline for several sales and see them appear correctly in DB after reconnection.

### 🔹 M11 – Offline for Purchases, Customers, Udhaar Payments

**Goal:** Extend offline-first behaviour beyond sales.

**Tasks:**
- **Purchases:**
  - Add `purchases` store in IndexedDB:
    - `{ id, shopId, supplierId?, date, reference?, notes?, lines[], syncStatus }`.
  - When creating a purchase:
    - Write to local store as PENDING.
    - If online:
      - Send to `/api/purchases` or `/api/purchases/sync-batch`.
  - `POST /api/purchases/sync-batch`:
    - Same idempotent logic as sales.
- **Customers:**
  - Add `customers` store with `isLocalOnly`, `syncStatus`.
  - New customers from POS:
    - Create local record with client ID.
    - Sync to `/api/customers/sync-batch` when online.
- **Udhaar payments:**
  - Add `udhaarPayments` store:
    - `{ id, shopId, customerId, amount, method, note?, createdAt, syncStatus }`.
  - When recording payment:
    - Save locally with PENDING.
    - If online, send to `/api/customers/:id/udhaar-payment` or `/api/udhaar-payments/sync-batch`.
- **Sync worker updates:**
  - Now also sync purchases, customers, udhaarPayments via their batch APIs.
- **Testing:**
  - Run offline test:
    - Create new customer, udhaar sale, and udhaar payment all offline.
    - Reconnect and confirm:
      - Customer exists on server with same ID.
      - Invoice created with UDHAAR.
      - CustomerLedger debits and credits correct.
      - Final balance matches local expectation.

**Done when:**
- Sales, purchases, customers, udhaar payments can be created offline and appear correctly on server after reconnection.

### 🔹 M12 – Customers & Udhaar UI (Online+Offline Integrated)

**Goal:** Smooth user experience around customers + udhaar.

**Tasks:**
- **Frontend:**
  - `/backoffice/customers`:

    - Header: name, phone, notes, balance.
    - Tabs or sections:
      - Udhaar invoices list.
      - Payments list.
    - "Receive Payment" button → payment form.
  - **POS:**
    - During udhaar sale:
      - Customer search (using local DB first).
      - Quick-add with Name + Phone.
- **Backend:**
  - `/api/customers`:
    - GET → list with balances (or allow client to compute).
    - POST → create customer.
  - `/api/customers/:id`:
    - GET → detail (basic info + last N invoices/payments).
  - `/api/customers/:id/udhaar-payment`:
    - Already there from earlier step.
- **Testing:**
  - Realistic flows:
    - Customer buys on udhaar multiple times.
    - Partial payments on different days.
    - Balance in UI matches ledger math.

**Done when:**
- Owner can manage customers & udhaar fully from UI (with offline support already wired under the hood).

### 🔹 M13 – Void & Edit Sales

**Goal:** Let owner fix mistakes without corrupting data or sync.

**Tasks:**
- **Backend:**
  - Add VOID to InvoiceStatus.
  - Domain function `voidInvoice(id, user)`:

- **Frontend:**
  - Sales list:
    - Show status badge (COMPLETED / VOID).
    - Buttons:
      - Void (confirm dialog).
      - Edit → open POS-like edit screen.
  - **Offline:**
    - For v1, you can make void/edit online only if complexity is too high.
    - Or store void/edit actions in local DB and sync similar to sales.
- **Testing:**
  - Void:
    - Create sale, then void.
    - Check:
      - Invoice status = VOID.
      - Stock restored.
      - CustomerLedger adjusted for udhaar.
  - Edit:
    - Create sale, edit it.
    - Old invoice VOID, new invoice present with updated values.
    - Stock+ledger reflect only final state.

**Done when:**
- Owner can void and "edit" any recent sale safely.

### 🔹 M14 – Daily Summary

### 🔹 M15 – Platform Admin Polish

**Goal:** Make admin tools actually useful to you as the platform owner.

**Tasks:**
- Enhance `/admin/shops`:
  - Show `lastActiveAt` (from a Shop field updated on activity).
  - Filters: active/inactive.
  - Add actions:
    - Activate/Deactivate shop (affects login).
    - Reset owner password (manual field for now).
- Implement impersonation:
  - Simple approach:
    - As admin, click "Login as owner".
    - Backend sets a special admin-impersonation session for that user.

**Done when:**
- You can manage shops completely from UI (no more manual Prisma Studio for basic ops).

### 🔹 M16 – Receipt Printing (Thermal Printer)

**Goal:** Print receipts on thermal printers (58mm/80mm) when available.

**Done when:**
- Receipts print correctly on thermal printers when available.
- System gracefully handles no-printer scenario (sale still completes).

### 🔹 M17 – Polish, QA & Deployment Prep

**Goal:** Clean enough to onboard 1–3 real shops.

**Tasks:**
- **Validation & UX:**
  - Clear error messages for required fields.
  - Loading states, disabled buttons for in-flight actions.
  - Confirmations for destructive actions (void, etc.).
- **Security:**
  - Check every API route enforces:
    - Auth.
    - Shop scoping (user must belong to that shop).
    - Role checks (cashier vs owner vs admin).
- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Basic server logging for errors.
  - Simple error boundary on frontend.
- **Vercel:**
  - Connect repo to Vercel.

    - Evening: udhaar payments + daily summary.

**Done when:**
- You're comfortable giving this to a real friendly shop owner to use as "beta".

---

### 📝 Notes on Roadmap

**UI Library Choice:**
- **Tailwind CSS** is recommended for performance:
  - Smaller bundle size (only used classes included).
  - No runtime CSS-in-JS overhead.
  - Better tree-shaking and PWA caching.
  - More flexible for custom POS UI.
- Consider **Headless UI** or **Radix UI** for accessible components (modals, dropdowns, etc.).

**IndexedDB Library:**
- Consider **Dexie.js** for IndexedDB wrapper (simpler API than raw IndexedDB).
- Alternative: Plain IndexedDB if bundle size is critical.

**Offline Sync Strategy:**
- Client-generated IDs (UUID/ULID) ensure idempotent sync.
- Batch sync APIs handle multiple records efficiently.
- Sync worker runs on app load, network change, and periodic timer.

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing per milestone is acceptable for v1.
- Consider adding unit tests for domain logic (lib/domain) in later iterations.

## 13. v2+ Roadmap (Already Identified)

- Proper Urdu/English bilingual UI, including full Urdu labels and formatting.
- Sticker/label printing with barcodes.
- Split payments (cash + card, etc., in one sale).
- Item-level discounts.
- Manual invoice-level udhaar payment allocation UI.
- FBR integration for tax-compliant shops.
- Multi-branch / chain management.
- More advanced reports and analytics (possibly separate OLAP/analytics schema).
- Advanced costing methods (average cost, FIFO, better margin analytics).
- Better multi-device per shop conflict resolution and real-time syncing.
